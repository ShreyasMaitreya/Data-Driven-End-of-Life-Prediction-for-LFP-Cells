Lithium ion battery cells have a tendency to lose their charge holding capacity over a period of time due to several reasons some of them being,
Unwanted/side reactions between electrolyte and electrodes
Uneven heating/cooling of entire cell structure 
Drawing large currents from the cell
and many more

The code takes data for the residual capacity of a Lithium Iron Phosohate (LFP) type cell over 2201 cycles of charging and diacharging and then using linear regression tries to predict the end of life of the battery (I have set the end of life capacity to be 80%of initial capacity)
